# ExTask - Currency Converter

# Hi 👋, I'm Ivarovskiy. Welcome to my Angular Screening.

The following technologies were used in the development:

### Angular CLI
### Angular
### TypeScript
### PrimeNg
### Scss
### currency-flags
### primeicons
### pipes / services

### The API used is - openexchangerates
### To display the current exchange rate and for conversion we used 2 queries - /latest.json, /currencies.json
### The current rate is updated every minute

## 📝 I went a bit off the requirements, had an idea of how I'd like to see this app, and I hope you like it

## Thanks for your attention! 🤝
